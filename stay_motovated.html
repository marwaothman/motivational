  <h1 id="title4"> How to Stay Motivated and Enthusiastic</h1>
      <div class="one">
        <p>To achieve anything, you need to learn to stay motivated. 
            You should supply yourself with constant triggers, so you can 
            continue despite obstacles. When you follow a certain activity for
             some time, it often turns into a habit, and you can go on 
             and on with it, as if on auto-pilot. Yet, knowing how to stay
              motivated would make the journey to achievement easier, faster 
              and more enjoyable. Everything worthwhile requires time, work and 
              effort. You need your motivation alive and kicking for days, weeks, months
               or even more, depending on your goal.</p>

        <p>If you often hear yourself saying, “I need motivation”,
             or “how to stay motivated even when facing delays, frustration
              and disappointment?”, here are a few tips to help. Here is how to have motivation:

              Ways to increase motivation levels.
              
              Think about the times you had motivation, and write down what were the triggers.
               It doesn’t matter in what area you were motivated to act. Then, think 
               and find ways to create the same conditions and triggers again, but in 
               relation to your current goal.</p>

            It doesn’t matter in what area you were motivated to act. Then, think and find ways 
            to create the same conditions and triggers again, but in relation to your current goal.
            Make a list of motivational and inspirational books that helped you in the past. Each day, 
            read at least a few pages from one of the books. If you have never read a book that motivated you, 
            start reading one now. Ask friends about such books, or search for them on the Internet.
            Instead of watching movies that you will forget tomorrow and leave no effect on you, seek, 
            and watch movies that can trigger motivation in you. Make a list of inspiring quotes and read them often, 
            especially in the morning before going to work, and at night, before going to sleep. You can find many such affirmations 
            at this website.
            Read success stories, about people who achieved success in the areas that you want to achieve success.
            Collect photos of things you want to do or own and look at them often to get inspired and motivated.
            Seek the company of people who have an uplifting effect on you and try to avoid the company of negative 
            people who try to drag you down intentionally or unintentionally. Start with small, simple goals. Since it is easier 
            to maintain motivation for short periods, it would be easier to keep the motivation, when the goal does not require much 
            time to accomplish, just a few minutes, hours, or a day or two.
            Repeat positive affirmations relating to your goal. If you don’t know what affirmations are or how to use them, 
            read this article about affirmations.
            To feel motivated, listen to music that you love, and which makes you feel energetic and alive.
            Focusing on the task at hand, even if you feel lack of enthusiasm, would increase the motivation in the
            long run.</p>
